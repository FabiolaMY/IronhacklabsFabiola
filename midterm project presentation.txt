NETFLIX MIDTERM PROJECT
Group Memebers: Nayan Naik and Fabiola Manjoh
Type of Project: Business Intelligence - Visualisations in Tableau

	we will be using a Netflix data set fron Kaggle.com titled Netflix Movies and Tv Shows and it has 11 columns and 8807 rows that
consists lists of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix as of  Oct 18th, 2021, along with details like - type, movie/tv show 
cast, directors, country of production,ratings, the actual release year, duration, genre(listed_in) and description just to name a few.
The data is Categorical in nature so its a good fit for our visualisation
The data is fairly clean that is the column names are already in lower case and it doesnt have as many null values and even when present 
doesnt affect the result of our work as much as we aim to focus on Visualisations.The requires adjustments so that it can serve the purpose
for whoch we plan to use some of which will be listed below.
Some of the cleaning steps are:
	-checking to see percentage of missing values in each column with the descsion to drop if its more than 40%
	-Adjusting the listed_in column so that each row is identified/grouped with a particular genre of film as it will make it 
possible and easier for visualisations
	-Grouping the unique values in the listed_in column so that visualtions are possible and make more sense
*Visualisataions to be made. The goal is to be able show things like
	-The country in which the most netflix movies are produced
	-Visualise the various genres available on Netflix
	-The most popular drector for Netflix movies
	-which type (movies or tv shows) are more available
	-The proportion of movies or Tv shows in a genre
