OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT

What problem are we trying to solve with/for Netflix and what is the purpose of our visualisation

OPTIONS
-We can talk about the fact that corona caused more people to stay at home and hence subscribe to the platform and
 hence causing a huge surge in the numbers and the platform had to adjust to this surge in deciding what to produce 
what to add on the platform and how to kake recommendation to the new subscribers to keep them and the old ones to also keep
them from propbably cahnging subscriptions

   -They needed to be aware of the subscribers preferences with respect to type (movie or tv show , with respect to the genre
 with respect to the duration that is how much time viewers are willing to invest in watvhing amovie or  tv show so that they know
 how to move forward and better handle 
        
 -They need to be aware of things like popularity of actors withing a given time frame to contribute to the descision of weather or
not adding a movie that has a particular cast will be good for them as a business and will allow thier subscribers to enjoy what they
are watching as that could ba factor that affects the viewings
 - (Completed) *which countries (top ten) are the biggest in production of netflix movies and maybe lookk at what genre the top three countires are 
most prolific in (as that may mean there is more efficiency in producing such a genre in the mentioned country or that genre is more popular
 in that country reasin why that gnere is being produced in the country etc) so that they focus efforts of producing the determined genre in 
the country determined to most prolific in 
            *Because Netflix is a Us b
 -show the ratings of the genres and their numbers to see how many shows/movies were available in what rating and maybe compare to the duration
of the show or movie to see a pattern with the duration of the movie/tv show and those allowed to watched

 -Show a trend of how content has been added over the past years to be able to show that the pandemic did have an effect on how much content was being added\
to platform (maybe give a back story to trend observed in the addition of movies ie how it was affected by corona). Also see the addition in quarters 
and also monthly and maybe the genre will explain why this experiences a surge in such times

OTHERs
-Launced its streaming service for Korean shows in 2016


-Thursday reported that it added 8.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, falling short of its initial forecast of 8.5 million.
probably because they had expectations that matched to a situation (corona) which werent met as things got better in 2021 and over predictions were made
-In 2019, Netflix produced 2,769 hours of original content. This is 80.15% more original content compared to the previous year. At the end of 2020,
 Netflix had over 2,000 Netflix originals

biggest bone of contention between Amazon Prime and Netflix has been the size of the content library. Amazon Prime has a smaller 
library of available titles, but tends to offers more of the latest movies and TV shows for instant watching. Netflix, on the other 
hand only offers TV shows and movies that are over a year
 old (with the exception of Netflix's own productions), but has a much larger library of shows and movies than Amazon.
