PRESENTATION GUIDE
Project Objective/Purpose
-To observe/analyse and see how the release and addition of content on Netflix has 
evolved over the years  
-To see peak changes and research what might have been the cause for those changes
 (research beyond the data but related to the data)
-Discuss factors that might have contributed to the trend movement and peak changes

DATA DESCRIPTION
we will be using a Netflix data set fron Kaggle.com titled Netflix Movies and Tv Shows and
it has 11 columns and 8807 rows that consists lists of all the movies and tv shows available
on Netflix as of  Oct 18th, 2021, along with details like - type, movie/tv show cast,
directors, country of production,ratings, the actual release year, duration, genre(listed_in) 
and description just to name a few.
The data is Categorical in nature so its a good fit for our visualisation
The data is fairly clean that is the column names are already in lower case and it doesnt 
have as many null values and even when present doesnt affect the result of our work as much
as we aim to focus on Visualisations.The requires adjustments so that it can serve the
purpose for which we plan to use some of which will be listed below.
Some of the cleaning steps (done with python) are:
	-checking to see percentage of missing values in each column with the descsion to 
	drop if its more than 40%
	-Adjusting the listed_in column so that each row is identified/grouped with a 
	particular genre of film as it will make it possible and easier for visualisations
	-Grouping the unique values in the listed_in column so that visualtions are possible
	 and make more sense

GENERIC VIEW OF OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
-The graph shows that Netflix produces more Movies tha Tv shows as content and that could have several 
resoons some of which are the fact that movies in their nature are shorter and mostly likely 90mins as
the graph of the duration and tv shows are longer in nature with one season being the most popular duration 
as per the graphs but one episode of a series has a median run time 55 minutes (as per thrillst.com)

-The graph on year added shows a spike in amount of movies added in 2011 which we could think it was because thing 
were going well but its actually the opposite as netflix almost crashed becaused or several reason and lost about
800.000 subscribers and we can only assume that the spike in	
-There is also a spike in amount of Tv shows added around 2016 and that can be partially explained by the descision 
to stream Korean movies as they were already popular and well received by viewers when introduced on the platform
-The graph continues with showing a steady fall in addition of movies from 2017 and continues to fall to 2021 but 
with some sort of steady slope with tv shows which can also be explained by the pandemic as people were likely to 
have more time to spare and spent more time at home which made it possible for the steady slope

CONTENT RELEASE(release year)
The graph on relaease year shows a constant growth in the release of content by netflix until there is a
drastic drop in 2020 and that can be explained by the fact that many productions for many movies and tv shows
for not only netflix had to be halted or were slowed down in a bid to take precaution due to the pandemic 
(safety reasons)

TOP COUNTRIES AND GENRES
-It shows that the most popular country for Netflix movies production is the US which makes sense as Netflix is a 
US based company and it maybe more efficient to produce content in the base country
-We can also see that the top five content genres are almost identical in all the countries though in different
 proportions which would mean that people around the world are interested in similar things irrespective of where 
they are with comedy being the most popular in Us and second most popular in India


FEED BACK
The slides too busy especially the slide on objectives (reducing it intovarious slides
	*seprate the objectiveb and data description
Genreic view
	*we should read a log scake chart to show those peak changes
	*show the names of the axis
Release year
	 Make it clear especially explanation
There is no connection between the slides. The story is not connected and the choice of charts problematic too
