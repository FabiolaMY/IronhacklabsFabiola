OBJECTIVE
How Netflix has evolved over the years in terms of its content and some insights about peak changes 

CONCLUSIONS ON VISUALISATION

*Proportion of content in platform
-The graph shows that Netflix produces more Movies tha Tv shows as content and that could have several resoons
 some of which are the fact that movies in their nature are shorter and mostly likely 90mins as the graph of the 
duration and tv shows are longer in nature with one season being the most popular duration as per the graphs but
one episode of a series has a median run time 55 minutes (as per thrillst.com)

-The graph on relaease year shows a constant growth in the release of content by netflix until there is a drastic 
drop in 2020 and that can be explained by the fact that many productions for many movies and tv shows for not only 
netflix had to be halted or were slowed down in a bid to take precaution due to the pandemic (safety reasons)
-The graph on year added shows a spike in amount of movies added in 2011 which we could think it was because thing 
were going well but its actually the opposite as netflix almost crashed becaused or several reason and lost about
800.000 subscribers and we can only assume that the spike in movies added was in a bit to entise the customers to 
keep from unsybscribing from the platform
-There is also a spike in amount of Tv shows added around 2016 and that can be partially explained by the descision 
to stream Korean movies as they were already popular and well received by viewers when introduced on the platform
-The graph continues with showing a steady fall in addition of movies from 2017 and continues to fall to 2021 but 
with some sort of steady slope with tv shows which can also be explained by the pandemic as people were likely to 
have more time to spare and spent more time at home which made it possible for the steady slope

*Top countries and top Genres
-It shows that the most popular country for Netflix movies production is the US hich makes sense as Netflix is a 
US based company and it maybe more efficient to produce content in the base country
-We can also see that the top five content genres are alost identical in all the countries though in different
 proportions which would mean that people around the world are interested in similar things irrespective of where 
they are with comedy being the most popularin Us and second most popular in India
